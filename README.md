Tapered fibre simulations by wave optic package of COMSOL version 5.5 and non-sequential mode of Zemax version 19.8.

   ## 1. Zemax simulations
   
  The Zemax simulation parameter can be found in 'Zemax_parameters.txt'. 
  
  The Zemax user's interface screenshot can be found in 'zemax-screenshot.jpeg'. All description of the interface can be found in Zemax_parameters.txt'. The screenshot showed the main display for parameter adjustment: 3D layout, Detector and Data Editor.
  
  The step-index tapered fibre model file name is si5to1_taper_down201119 which is available in both .zmx and .zda
  
  The graded-index tapered fibre model file name is 50_gi5to1_taper_down_grin_20052020 which is available in both .zmx and .zda
   
  ## 2. COMSOL simulations
  
The COMSOL simulation parameter can be found in 'ComsolPara.txt'. 

The COMSOL User's interface screenshot can be found in 'Comsol_mode4_GI_0.20t.pspimage'

  COMSOL file is adjustable for both step-index and graded-index tapered fibre by changing the parameters. The COMSOL file is 2DTaperFinal.mph
