# Fibre-model-comsol
Tapered fibre simulation by COMSOL version 5.5 and Zemax version 19.8 with non-sequential mode.


The Zemax simulation parameter can be found in 'Zemax_parameters.txt'. 

Zemax simulations parameter setup can be foud in are 5:1 step-index tapered fibre and 5:1 graded-index tapered fibre.   
  The step-index tapered fibre model file name is si5to1_taper_down201119 which is available in both .zmx and .zda
  The graded-index tapered fibre model file name is 50_gi5to1_taper_down_grin_20052020 which is available in both .zmx and .zda

COMSOL simulations parameter setup can be foud in are 5:1 step-index tapered fibre and 5:1 graded-index tapered fibre.
