# Fibre-model-comsol
Tapered fibre simulations by wave optic package of COMSOL version 5.5 and non-sequential mode of Zemax version 19.8.

The Zemax simulation parameter can be found in 'Zemax_parameters.txt'. 
  The step-index tapered fibre model file name is si5to1_taper_down201119 which is available in both .zmx and .zda
  The graded-index tapered fibre model file name is 50_gi5to1_taper_down_grin_20052020 which is available in both .zmx and .zda
   
The COMSOL simulation parameter can be found in 'ComsolPara.txt'. 
  COMSOL file can be adjustable for both step-index and graded-index tapered fibre by changing the parameters. The COMSOL file is 2DTaperFinal.mph
